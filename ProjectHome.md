MediaRC is a remote control program intended for controlling your various media devices found in a home theater or with a PVR like MythTV. It is an extendable program for which new drivers can easily be added.

MediaRC currently can control IR devices through LIRC, the sound levels through ALSA, and serial devices like a TV.
